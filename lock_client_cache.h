// SUGGESTED LOCK CACHING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:
//
// to work correctly for lab 7,  all the requests on the server run till 
// completion and threads wait on condition variables on the client to
// wait for a lock.  this allows the server to be replicated using the
// replicated state machine approach.
//
// On the client a lock can be in several states:
//  - free: client owns the lock and no thread has it
//  - locked: client owns the lock and a thread has it
//  - acquiring: the client is acquiring ownership
//  - releasing: the client is releasing ownership
//
// in the state acquiring and locked there may be several threads
// waiting for the lock, but the first thread in the list interacts
// with the server and wakes up the threads when its done (released
// the lock).
//
// a thread is in charge of getting a lock: if the server cannot grant
// it the lock, the thread will receive a retry reply.  at some point
// later, the server sends the thread a retry RPC, encouraging the client
// thread to ask for the lock again.
//
// once a thread has acquired a lock, its client obtains ownership of
// the lock. the client can grant the lock to other threads on the client 
// without interacting with the server. 
//
// the server must send the client a revoke request to get the lock back. this
// request tells the client to send the lock back to the
// server when the lock is released or right now if no thread on the
// client is holding the lock.  when receiving a revoke request, the
// client adds it to a list and wakes up a releaser thread, which returns
// the lock the server as soon it is free.
//
// the releasing is done in a separate a thread to avoid
// deadlocks and to ensure that revoke and retry RPCs from the server
// run to completion (i.e., the revoke RPC cannot do the release when
// the lock is free.
//
// a challenge in the implementation is that retry and revoke requests
// can be out of order with the acquire and release requests.  that
// is, a client may receive a revoke request before it has received
// the positive acknowledgement on its acquire request.  similarly, a
// client may receive a retry before it has received a response on its
// initial acquire request.  a flag field is used to record if a retry
// has been received.
